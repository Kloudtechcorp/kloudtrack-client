    Severe damage will occur to makeshift or old, dilapidated of light structures, and other structures made of light materials. Houses of poor or average construction may receive major damage, including complete roof failure and possible wall collapse; a few may suffer severe damage.
    Most well-constructed houses may sufer minor to moderate roof damage, with some houses experiencing major roof failure; blown out windows are also likely.
    Failure of aluminum and steel roofs and ceverings may occure in buildings at industrial parks.
    Some glass in most high-rise office buildings may be blown out; a few of these buildings may have minor to moderate damage and higher proportion of blown-out windows due to swaying.
    Considerable airborne debris willbe generated and may cause damage, injury, and possible fatalities.
    Near total loss of power supply and telecommunications due to numerous downed power lines, poles, and cellular towers. Diminished availability of potable water supply is also likely.
    Significant to severe disruption to public transportation.
    Significant damage to banana and similar plants. Most small tress and some large trees will be broken, defoliated, or uprooted. Almost total damage to rice and other crops.

    Severe to catasrophic damage is expected to houses of poor or average construction, makeshift or old, dilapidated structures, and other structures made of light materials. Well-constructed houses may suffer substatial roof and wall failure or damage.
    Many industrial buildings will be destroyed, with only few receiving partial roof and wall damage.
    Most windows will be blowdn out n high-rise office buildings; Moderate structural damage is possible due to swaying.
    Extensive damage will be cause by airborne debris. People, pets, and livestock exposed to the wind are at great risk of injury or death.
    Electricity, potable water supply, and telecommunications will be unavailable for prolonged periods due to significant disruption in infrastructure.
    Prolonged significant to severe disruption to pucblic transportation.
    Vast majority of the trees will be broken, defoliated, or unrooted. Banana and similar plants will be extensively damaged. Few strees, plants, and crops will survive.
